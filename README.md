<h3 align="center">A cli for Windows Terminal</h3>

This is the Windows Terminal Terminal binary.

To compile the binary, run ``node build.js`` and the build process should automatically happen (which includes checksums)

### Bugs
- Checksum is different every time (maybe because of Node execution) ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
